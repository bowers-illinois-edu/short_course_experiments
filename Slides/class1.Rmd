# Overview and Review

## Overview of the class {.allowframebreaks}

**At the end be able to answer questions like:**

- **Why choose a randomized experiment?**
- **What is a counterfactual quantity and why might we care about this?**
 - How can we randomize using R?
 - **Why test? Why estimate? How test and estimate? What is randomization based
   inference and why should we care?** How can we use R to test hypotheses
   about counterfactual quantities? How can we use R to estimate average causal
   effects (differences of averages of counterfactual quantities)?
 - How might we know when it is worth randomizing and when it is not?
   (Statistical power) **What is statistical power? Why should we care?**

## Overview of the class {.allowframebreaks}
 - How should we make choices about certain common designs:
   - Why might one randomize within strata? What does this imply for analysis
     and interpretation?
   - Why might one randomize an intervention to groups or clusters of units?
     What does this imply for analysis and interpretation?
   - How might we use randomization to learn about the effects of interventions
     even when we cannot control who receives a full dose of the treatment?
     (LATE/CACE)

# Experiments in context: Research questions, theories, and research designs

## What makes a research question good?

- The answer to a good research question should produce knowledge that people
  will care about, that will change beliefs, that will inspire action.

- Addressing the question should (help) solve a problem, (help) make a decision, or
  clarify/challenge our understanding of/explanations about the world.

- That is, a good question arises in the context of a theory and in the context of values.

- But an interesting question is not enough to make the change in the world that we'd like to see

## We also need a good research design

 - A good research design is a practical plan for research that makes the best
  use of available resources and produces a credible answer.

 - The quality of a research design can be assessed by how well it produces
  results that can be used to guide policy and improve science:

    - A great research design produces results that clearly point in certain
      directions that we care about.

    - A poor research design produces results that leave us in the dark ---
      results with confusing interpretation, ambiguity in interpretation.

 - The point of most social and behavioral science experimental research design
   is to learn about theory not about the world per se. (This points is often
   not appreciated in policy experiments. The confusion arises often in
   discussions of "external validity" or "generalizability".)

## The importance of theory {.allowframebreaks}

All research design involves theory, whether implicit or explicit.

 - **Why do the research?** We have implicit theories and values which guide the
   questions we ask. Our questions are value laden: For example, social
   scientists studied marijuana use in the 1950s as a form of "deviance", the
   questions focused on "why are people making such bad decisions?" or "how can
   policy makers prevent marijuana use?" [see @howardsbecker1998a].

 - **Why do the research?** We might want to change how scientists explain the world
  and/or change the policy decisions in (a) one place and time and/or (b) in
  other places and times.

 - Research focused on learning the causal effect of an intervention, $X$, on
   an outcome, $Y$, requires a model of the world: *how* might intervention $X$
   might have an effect on some outcome $Y$, and *why*, and *how large* might
   be the effect?  It helps us think about how a different intervention or
   targeting different recipients might lead to different results.

 - Designing research will often clarify where we are less certain about our
  theories.  Our theories will point to problems with our design. And questions
  arising from the process of design may indicate a need for more work on
  explanation and mechanism.

## Designing or selecting your treatment

- Your treatment and control need to clearly connect to your
  research question.

- The treatment you're interested in might be a bundle of multiple components.
  If your research question is about one specific component, then the control
  should be different from the treatment in just that component.  Everything
  else should be the same.

## An example

A campaign where someone visits a home to talk with a family for 15 minutes to
share health information.

  - If you're interested in the effect of the specific information, then your
      control should still have all the other components (home visit with 15
      minutes duration, similar visitor, etc.) but have different information.
      This design will not teach you about the effect of visits, just about the
      effect of information.

  - If your question focuses on the effect of visits, then you need a control
      group without a visit.  But this design will not do a good job answering
      specific questions about information (visits and information are
      bundled together).

## Interpretation

- Sometimes it's not possible to separate out a specific component of your
  treatment.

- For example, your partner community health organization that visits homes may
  not be interested in visiting homes and sharing non-health information. Then your
  control might be no visit.

- You must be careful to interpret your effects as the effect of the
  information delivered in this particular way.

- You will not be able to conclude that you have estimated the effect of only
  the information.

    - This might be fine for certain policy purposes: maybe the policy question
      is about the visits as an implicit bundle of treatments.

    - But it is difficult to interpret the results of this design as telling us
      something clear about information alone.


## The Research Process: Questions, theory, and credibility

 - Research starts with our values and theories about how the world works.

 - It continues by articulating questions that can be clearly addressed by observation (in this course, using randomized experimentation).

 - Good questions have consequential answers: changing scientific explanations, changing policy decisions.

 - Good designs tick all the boxes and give readers reason to believe the results.

 - Not all randomized experiments are good designs. And not all good designs are randomized experiments.

# Why experiment?


## Policy experiments

A method for: \medskip

- Putting beliefs about what works to the test
- Enabling policy decisions based on data

## An example experiment (Wantchekon et al)

- Question: are programmatic policies or clientelistic policies more effective at mobilizing voters?
- Why we care: Programmatic policies can be more equitable, pro-poor
- Idea: politicians believe clientelistic policies are more effective -- and maybe they would change campaigns if they knew they were wrong
- Research partner: four main parties in Benin
- Intervention: programmatic policy or clientelistic policy promoted by party at election rallies in a district
- Experimental design: campaign randomly assigned to districts
- Outcome: vote share for the party
- Results: on average voters prefer clientelistic campaigns, but women more likely to prefer programmatic policies

## An example experiment (Wantchekon et al)

Random assignment $\rightarrow$ **highly credible evidence** and **easy to
interpret evidence** that the change to messages at rallies led to a change in
vote share \bigskip

If politicians believe results $\rightarrow$ decide to change campaigns


## Long history of the method


- Late 1700s, early 1800s: early double-blind experiments with comparison group (not randomized)
- 1920s: first randomized experiments in agriculture, education, and political science
- 1965: first clinical randomized trial (Streptomycin for TB)
- 2019: Nobel prize for popularizing randomized experiments in economics

## Widespread use


- Clinical trials required by regulators for vaccines, medicines, and treatments
- Political campaigns test mobilization and persuasion strategies
- Tech companies test website features to find most lucrative ones
- Governments test policies using RCTs

## Opposing existing beliefs I (EGAP Accountability Metaketa, Dunning et al)

- Belief: providing information about incumbent politicians will change votes
- Intervention: information about politicians' corruption, job attendance
- Experimental design: randomly assign districts to receive information or not
- Outcome: vote share for incumbent (administrative data)
- Result: no effect


## Oppositing existing beliefs II

- Belief: local democratic institutions improve delivery of development aid
- Partner: International Rescue Committee,CARE
- Intervention: two years of democratic institutions and development program
- Experimental design: randomly assign village clusters to treatment or not
- Outcomes: corruption, government practices chosen after intervention
- Result: no change


## Opposing existing beliefs III (EGAP Community Policing Metaketa)

- Belief: engagement between police & citizens improves trust, lowers crime
- Partner: Police agencies in six countries
- Intervention: "community policing" (townhalls, beat patrols, etc.)
- Experimental design: randomly assign police beats to receive/not
- Outcomes: citizen trust in and cooperation with police, crime
- Result: no change in any main outcome


## Supporting existing theories beliefs

- Belief: conditional cash transfers change behavior, improve welfare
- Partner: Mexico public health ministry
- Intervention: cash to mothers conditioned on children attending school, going to health clinics
- Experimental design: first phase of rollout randomly assigned to communities
- Outcomes: poverty, school attendance, health
- Result: improvements in every outcome

Turkey, US


## Limitations to experiments

Some questions don't need an experiment\medskip

- Does smoking cause poor health? (This took many years of observational
  studies including laboratory and epidemiology studies)
- Do parachutes help when you jump out of a plane? (Back to theory \ldots)

## Limitations to experiments

Some questions shouldn't have an experiment \medskip

- Does changing the interest rate affect inflation?
- Were the funds from the American Rescue Plan distributed equitably?
- What is the poverty rate?
- Why didn't information affect accountability? Why didn't community policing change trust?

Important role for descriptive research, theory generation, qualitative
investigation


## Limitations to experiments

- Ethics --- is this sort of manipulation ethical? Sometimes not.

- Must be done in real time, ahead of the intervention roll-out. (Can't run a
  new randomized experiment on data that has already been collected.)

- Reduced flexibility for a partner organization (problem for any prospective evaluation).

- Maybe Cost if it implies more administration and/or new measurement.

## Why experiments


 - Put beliefs about effects of policies to the test.
 - Offer clear evidence for and/or against existing theories.

# Experiments and the Counterfactual Approach to Causal Inference

## Experiments and Counterfactual Causal Inference

\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../Images/MorrowPlots.jpg}

## Did the fertilizer cause more corn to grow?

Each plot either receives the fertilizer or status quo.

What does it mean for fertilizer to **cause** more corn to grow? Perhaps
someone suggests a causal mechanism (fertilizer $\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow
$ corn)? Perhaps someone suggests another mechanism that does not involve
fertilizer (?sun light? ?music?)

How to provide evidence about the causal mechanism? One implication of the
theory: if the plot of land had not received fertilizer, then less corn would
have grown.

## "X causes Y" is a claim about what didn't happen

- In the counterfactual approach: "If X had not occurred, then Y would not have occurred."

- Experiments help us learn about counterfactual and manipulation-based claims about causation.

- It's not wrong to _conceptualize_ "cause" in another way (for example,
  whenever I see fertilized fields, I expect more corn.). But the
  counterfactual framework has made discussion of the design and analysis of
  experiments easier [@brady2008causation].

- For example, we can have mechanistic explanation linking fertilizer to corn
  growth (fertilizer does something to the corn cells to trigger increased
  growth) but also a covering law theory (without nutrients, corn cannot grow).
  The counterfactual idea helps us relate specific implications to specific
  observations.


## How to interpret "X causes Y" in this approach

1.  "X causes Y" need not imply that other variables W and V do not cause Y: X is a part of the story, not the whole story. (The whole story is not necessary in order to learn about whether X causes Y). Music could be a part of the cause. Or sunlight.

2.  "X causes Y" requires a **context**: matches cause flame but require oxygen; small classrooms improve test scores but require experienced teachers and funding [@cartwright2012evidence]; corn requires soil and oxygen and reasonable temperatures.

3. "X causes Y" can mean "With X, the probability of Y is higher than would be without X." or "Without X there is no Y." Either is compatible with the counterfactual idea.

4.  It is not necessary to know the mechanism to establish that X causes Y. The mechanism can be complex, and it can involve probability: X causes Y sometimes because of A and sometimes because of B. (In fact, in science we often have "X causes Y" and then decades of research work to narrow down the causal mechanism.)

## Exercise: Colds and Honey

- Your friend says drinking honey water reduces the duration of colds.

- If we take a counterfactual approach, what does this statement implicitly
  claim about the counterfactual?

- If we saw that people who drank honey water also tended to have shorter
   colds, would that confirm the causal claim? What other counterfactuals might
   be possible and why?

## Potential outcomes notation for counterfactual causal effects

- Given two possible treatments, for each unit we formalize the simple versin of the counterfactual idea by writing that there are two **post-treatment** outcomes: $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$.

- $Y_i(1)$ is the outcome that **would** obtain *if* the unit received the treatment ($T_i=1$).

- $Y_i(0)$ is the outcome that **would** obtain *if* the unit received the treatment ($T_i=0$).

A unit can be a plot of land at a moment in time, a village, a person, etc.

## Definition of causal effect

- An additive **causal effect** of treatment (relative to control) is:
	$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$

- We could also write $\tau_i = Y_i(1)/Y_i(0)$ --- how much did person $i$ earn
  after the training program as a ratio?


- Or other functions relating the potential outcomes.

## Key features of this definition of causal effect

1. You have to define two conditions to define a causal effect.
    - Say $T=1$ means a community meeting to discuss public health.  Is $T=0$
      no meeting at all?  Is $T=0$ a community meeting on a different subject?
      Is $T=0$ a flyer on public health?
    - The phrase "causal effect of $T$ on $Y$" doesn't make sense in
      counterfactual terms without knowing what is means to not have $T$ (for $T=0$).

2. Each individual unit $i$ has its own causal effect $\tau_i$.

3. But we can't measure the individual-level causal effect, because we can't observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ at the same time. This is known as the **fundamental problem of causal inference**. What we observe is $Y_i$:

\centering
$Y_i = T_iY_i(1) + (1-T_i)Y_i(0)$



## Imagine we know both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ (this is never true!)

| $i$      | $Y_i(1)$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $\tau_i$ |
|----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Andrei   | 1        | 1        | 0        |
| Bamidele | 1        | 0        | 1        |
| Claire   | 0        | 0        | 0        |
| Deepal   | 0        | 1        | -1       |

- We have the (additive) treatment effect for each individual.

- Note that individual-level treatment effects differ.

- But we only have at most one potential outcome for each individual, which means we don't directly see these treatment effects. We can only **infer** them.


# Concepts and Notation for Causal Inference and Statistical Inference

## Notation and Concepts for Counterfactual Causal Inference {.shrink}

  - *Treatment* or *Intevention*  $Z_i=1$ for treatment and $Z_i=0$ for control
    for units $i$. (We mostly assume that all units **could have** $Z_i=1$ or
    $Z_i=0$. That it is not impossible for any unit to have either value.) (Q:
    What is a unit? Examples of interventions?)

  - Each unit has a pair of *potential outcomes* $(y_{i,Z_i=1},y_{i,Z_i=0})$
    (also written  $(y_{i,1},y_{i,0})$ ) (given the Stable Unit Treatment Value
    Assumption (SUTVA)).
    - Without the SUTVA assumption, and with 4 units, with two having $Z_i=1$,
      unit $i=1$ would have the following potential outcomes:
      $(y_{i,1100},y_{i,1010},y_{i,1001},y_{i,0101},y_{i,0011})$
  - *Causal Effect under SUTVA*  when $y_{i,1} \ne y_{i,0}$, $\tau_i   =
    f(y_{i,1},y_{i,0})$ ex. $\tau_i =  y_{i,1} - y_{i,0}$.

  - *Fundamental Problem of (Counterfactual) Causality* We only see one
    potential outcome $Y_i = Z_i * y_{i,1} + (1-Z_i) y_{i,0}$ (Examples:
    Argentina having elected Mieli versus not? Chile under a new constitution
    versus not?)

  - *Covariates*,  $\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & \ldots & x_{1k} \\ \vdots &
    \vdots & \vdots \\  x_{n1} & \ldots & x_{nk} \end{bmatrix}$ is a matrix
    containing  background information about the units that might predict
    $(y_{i,1},y_{i,0})$ or $Z$ (but that don't predict $Z$ if $Z$ is randomized
    as in an experiment).

## The observation and unobserved causal comparisons

We can learn about unobserved but theorized causal mechanisms by observing the world [@brady2008cae]:

- **Persistent association** "We always/mostly see $Y=1$ when $X=1$ and $Y=0$
  when $X=0$."
- **Counterfactual Difference** "If  $X$ had not been this value, then $Y$
  would not have been that value."
- **Difference after manipulation** "When we change $X$ from one value to
  another value, then $Y$ changes from one value to another value."
  (establishes causal priority of $X$ over $Y$, implied that $Y$ would not have
  changed.).
- **Difference after operation of a mechanism** "Once upon a time $A$ changed
  $X$, and then one day $X$ changed $B$, and because of that $B$ changed $C$,
  and finally $C$ changed $Y$."

All approaches are useful. This week we are focusing on the counterfactual approach.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
set.seed(12345)
honeydat <- data.frame(x1=c(1,1,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,2),
    x2=sample(1:9,size=10,replace=TRUE))
honeydat$Zlat <- with(honeydat,.5*x1 + runif(10))
honeydat$Z <- as.numeric(honeydat$Z > median(honeydat$Z))
## honeydat$y0 <- with(honeydat,x1+x2+Z+rpois(10,lambda=5))
honeydat$y0 <- with(honeydat, x1 + .25*x1^2+rpois(10,lambda=8))
summary(lm(y0~x1+x2,data=honeydat))
## cor(honeydat[,c("x1","x2","Z","y0")])
honeydat$Zlat <- NULL
honeydat$y1 <- with(honeydat,y0 - c(1,1,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,2))
honeydat$Y <- with(honeydat,y1*Z + y0*(1-Z))
with(honeydat,mean(Y[Z==1]) - mean(Y[Z==0]))
honeydat$tau <- honeydat$y1 - honeydat$y0
honeydat$id <- 1:10
dat <- honeydat[,c("id","x1","x2","y0","y1","tau")]
```


## Randomization in Action: Honey and Colds {.shrink}

Your friend explains a causal mechanism that eating raw honey reduces the
duration of colds. What kinds of **alternative** explanations might we come up
with for this result?

Imagine these were the underlying potential outcomes with two covariates $x_1$ and $x_2$
representing two of those explanations and that $x_1 \rightarrow y_0$ and that
$x_2 \not \rightarrow y_0$. (Say, $x_2$ is "reading the newspaper" and $x_1$ is "going often to the doctor")

```{r}
kable(dat)
```

The true, unobserved, average (additive) causal effect is: `r with(honeydat, mean(y1-y0))`.

Let us run a randomized experiment and see how we do:

## An RCT:

Let's imagine that we randomized honey to 5 of the people in the friendship group. How would we know whether
`complete_ra` worked as it should? (First we asked ChatGPT what `complete_ra` does!)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(randomizr)
set.seed(12345)
dat$Z <- complete_ra(N=10,m=5)
dat$Y <- with(dat,Z*y1 + (1-Z)*y0)
```


## An RCT:

We see the potential outcomes (`y0` and `y1`) because this is a simulation. In
general, we only see `Y` and `Z` and the covariates `x1` and `x2`.

```{r}
kable(dat)
```

## Assessing randomization {.allowframebreaks}

We expect that the distributions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be (nearly) the same
between the treated and control groups. But how nearly the same? We write "0"
below, but in fact, randomization does not make those relationships exactly 0.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
	  Z  \arrow[from=1-1,to=1-4] &    &    & Y \\
	   x_1 \arrow[from=2-1,to=1-1, "\text{0 if $Z$ is randomized}"] \arrow[from=2-1,to=1-4] & & &
	   x_2 \arrow[from=2-4,to=1-1, "\text{0 if $Z$ is randomized}",sloped] \arrow[from=2-4,to=1-4]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Here, just looking at means:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
dat %>% group_by(Z) %>% reframe(mnx1=mean(x1),mnx2=mean(x2))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(RItools)
bal1 <- balanceTest(Z~x1+x2,data=dat)
bal1$results[,1:4,]
```

Is this what we should expect from a well-conducted experiment? Have we messed
up the code?

## What **should** we expect from an experiment?

...in regards covariate balance? Lets simulate to learn: (let's explain this code)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
new_exp <- function(Z){
	newZ <- sample(Z)
	return(newZ)
}
diff_means <- function(x,Z){
	mean(x[Z==1]) - mean(x[Z==0])
}
all_cov_bal<- replicate(10000,diff_means(x=dat$x1,
					Z=new_exp(dat$Z)))
summary(all_cov_bal)
obs_cov_bal <- diff_means(dat$x1,dat$Z)
obs_cov_bal
```

## What **should** we expect from an experiment?

So:

1. experiments do not guarantee exact equality of covariates and
2. we can **know** (or closely approximate) what kind of covariate differences
   a given experimental design would generate.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
obs_cov_bal
quantile(all_cov_bal,seq(0,1,.1))
sd(all_cov_bal)
```


## What **should** we expect from an experiment?

1. experiments do not guarantee exact equality of covariates and
2. we can **know** (or closely approximate) what kind of covariate differences
   a given experimental design would generate.

These are the ways that the difference in mean `x1` can occur in our randomized
design.

```{r}
plot(table(all_cov_bal),type="h")
```

# Random assignment vs Random sampling 

## Randomization of treatment assignment

- Randomization means that every observation has a known probability of assignment to experimental conditions *between* 0 and 1.

  - No unit in the experimental sample is assigned to treatment with certainty (probability = 1) or to control with certainty (probability = 0).

- Units can vary in their probability of treatment assignment.

  - For example, the probability might vary by group:  women might have a 25\% probability of being assigned to treatment while men have a different probability.

  - It can even vary across individuals, though that would complicate your analysis.


## Random assignment of treatment vs. random sampling from a population

- Randomization (of treatment): assigning subjects with known probability to experimental conditions.

  - This random assignment of treatment can be combined with any kind of sample (random sample, convenience sample, etc.).

  - But the size and other characteristics of your sample will affect your power and your ability to extrapolate from your finding to other populations.

- Random sampling (from population): selecting subjects into your sample from a population with known probability.

## Random sampling

```{r randomsampling, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%',fig.cap='Random sample of households'}
knitr::include_graphics("../Images/randomsampling.pdf")
```

## Potential outcomes
Each household $i$ has `r colorize("$Y_i(1)$","red")` and `r colorize("$Y_i(0)$","blue")`.

```{r randomsamplingred, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%',fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("../Images/randomsampling_redblue_plain.png")
```

## Random assignment to red (1) or blue (0) condition

```{r randomassignment, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%',fig.cap='Random assignment of this random sample of households'}
knitr::include_graphics("../Images/randomassignment.png")
```

## Three key assumptions

To make causal claims with an experiment (or to judge whether we believe a study's claims), we need three core assumptions:

 - Random assignment of subjects to treatment, which implies that receiving the
   treatment is statistically independent of subjects' potential outcomes.

 - Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).

 - Excludability, which means that a subject‚Äôs potential outcomes respond only
   to the defined treatment, not other extraneous factors that may be
   correlated with treatment.

We will engage these assumptions more when we talk about testing and
estimation.  We used SUTVA above already when we shuffled `Z`.

## Key assumption: SUTVA, part 1

1. No interference --  A subject's potential outcome reflects only whether that subject receives the treatment himself/herself.  It is not affected by how treatments happen to be allocated to other subjects.

   - A classic violation is the case of vaccines and their spillover effects.

   - Say I am in the control condition (no vaccine).  If whether I get sick
     ($Y_i(0)$) depends on other people's treatment status (whether they take
     the vaccine), it's like I have two different $Y_i(0)$ (one for when I'm
     near a vaccinated person and one for when I am not)!

   - SUTVA (= stable unit treatment value assumption)

## Key assumption: SUTVA, part 2

2. No hidden variations or types of the treatment

   - Say treatment is taking a vaccine, but there are two kinds of vaccines and they have different ingredients.

   - An example of a violation is when whether I get sick when I take the
     vaccine: $Y_i(1)$ depends on which vaccine I got.  We would have two
     different $Y_i(1)$ --- one for vaccine 1 and another for vaccine 2!


## Key assumption: Excludability

- Treatment assignment has no effect on outcomes except through its effect on whether treatment was received.

  - Important to define the treatment precisely.

  - Important to also maintain symmetry between treatment and control groups
    (e.g., through blinding, having the same data collection procedures for all
    study subjects, etc.), so that treatment assignment only affects the
    treatment received, not other things like interactions with researchers
    that you don't want to define as part of the treatment.

  - Example: people in the treatment group (who know they got a vaccine) rush
    out to go dancing and then we see more sickness in that group.

  - Example: village not receiving payments (the control group) get targeted
    by an NGO for increased funds and support.

# What can we do with a randomized experiment?

## Average causal effect

 - While we can't measure the individual causal effect, $\tau_i = Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$, we can randomly assign subjects to treatment and control conditions to **define** an **average causal effect**, $\bar{\tau}_i$:

\centering
$\overline{\tau_i} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N ( Y_i(1)-Y_i(0) ) = \overline{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}$


 - The average causal effect is also known as the average treatment effect (ATE).

 - Further explanation on how and why we **estimate** this **estimand** after
   we discuss randomization of treatment assignment.


## Estimands and causal questions

- Before we discuss how randomization allows us to **estimate** the ATE, note that the ATE is a type of estimand or aggregation of individual level causal effects.

- An estimand is a quantity you want to learn about (from your data).  It's the target of your research that *you* set. The ATE is a common estimand. Another might be the difference in log odds:

  \begin{equation}
  \log\left( \frac{\bar{Y}_i(1)}{1 - \bar{Y}_i(1)} \right) - \log\left( \frac{\bar{Y}_i(0)}{1 - \bar{Y}_i(0)} \right)
  \end{equation}

- Being precise about your research question means being precise about which summaries of potential outcomes you want to learn about. For causal questions, this means specifying:
   - The outcome
   - The treatment and control conditions
   - The study population

## Other types of estimands you may be interested in

- The ATE for a particular subgroup, aka conditional average treatment effect (CATE)

- Differences in CATEs:  differences in the average treatment effect for one group as compared with another group.

- The ATE for just the treated units, aka ATT (average treatment effect on the treated)

- The local ATE (LATE).  "Local" = those whose treatment status would be changed by an encouragement in an encouragement design (aka CACE, complier average causal effect) or those in the neighborhood of a discontinuity for a regression discontinuity design.

- Estimands and estimators are discussed in detail later in the course.

## Randomization is powerful (4)

- If the intervention is randomized, then who receives or doesn't receive the intervention is not related to the characteristics of the potential recipients.

- Randomization makes those who were randomly selected to not receive the intervention to be good stand-ins for the counterfactuals for those who were randomly selected to receive the treatment, and vice versa.

- We have to worry about this if the intervention were not randomized (= an observational study).

## Different types of studies

- Randomized studies

   - Randomize treatment, then go measure outcomes

- Observational studies

   - Treatment is not randomly assigned.  It is observed, but not manipulated.

## Exercise: Observational studies vs. Randomized studies

Small group discussion. We have a theory that vaccine hesitance is less about
ideology and values and more about perceptions of social facts (how many other
people who are relevant to you who you think have been vaccinated). Sketch two
research designs to teach us about this theory.

**Tasks:**

  1. Sketch an ideal observational study design (no randomization, no
     researcher control but infinite resources for data collection). What
     questions would critical readers ask when you claim that your results
     reflect a causal relationship?

  2. Sketch an ideal experimental study design (including randomization).  What
     questions would critical readers ask when you claim that your results
     reflect a causal relationship?

# How to Randomize

## Randomization of treatment assignment

Start with a group units who you can directly observe: like the people who showed up to a lab, villages in a region, respondents willing to take a survey.

- Every observation has a known probability of treatment assignment between 0 and 1.

  - No unit in the experimental sample is assigned to treatment or to control with certainty.

- Units can vary in their probability of treatment assignment.

  - For example, the probability might vary by group: women might have a 75\% probability of being assigned to treatment.

  - Assignment probabilities can even vary across units **as long as you know the probability for each and every unit**, though that would complicate your analysis.

## Random assignment $\neq$ random sampling

- Random sampling (from population): selecting subjects into your sample from a population with known probability. You cannot directly observe the whole population so you draw a sample.

- Randomization (of treatment): assigning subjects from an existing group of
  subjects with known probability to experimental conditions.
  - You need to be able to see outcomes and assign treatment for every subject in the group
  - This random assignment of treatment can be combined with any kind of sample
    (random sample, convenience sample, etc.) or even with the whole population
    (all the hospitals, all the judges).

## Random assignment $\neq$ random sampling

- How you recruit your initial group (or experimental pool) matters:

  - a big initial group means a big experiment and more statistical power to
    detect small effects.

  - an initial group which is a random sample from a known population helps you
    make the argument that your effects might be the same or similar if you did
    this experiment with another sample from that population.

  - an experimental pool that is a random sample might also help with the
    argument that the effect should be similar if you scaled up the
    intervention to the whole population --- depending on the factors driving a
    global equilibrium.


## Randomization is closely linked to your research design

- Remember that you need to define and justify your control condition:
   - this may be no intervention
   - or a placebo

## Level of treatments and outcomes

- Treatment can be assigned at different levels: individuals, groups,
  institutions, communities, time periods, or many different levels.

- You may be constrained in what level you can _assign_ treatment and _measure_ outcomes.

  - Example: Treatment at the classroom level, but outcomes at the student level.

  - Example: Treatment at the district level, but outcomes at the community level.

- The level at which treatment is assigned and at which outcomes are measured affect what your study can demonstrate.

## Extra: Randomization is powerful (1)

- Say we want the ATE, $\overline{\tau_i}= \overline{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}$.

- We will make use of the fact that the average of differences equals the difference of averages to write it down:

\centering
ATE $= \overline{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)} = \overline{Y_i(1)}-\overline{Y_i(0)}$

## Extra: Randomization is powerful (2)

- Let's *randomly assign* some of our units to the treatment condition.  For these treated units, we measure the outcome $Y_i|T_i=1$, which is the same as $Y_i(1)$ for these units.

- Because these units were randomly assigned to treatment, these observed $Y_i=Y_i(1)$ for the treated units represent the $Y_i(1)$ for all our units.

- In expectation (or on average across repeated experiments (written $E_R[]$)):

\centering
$E_R[\overline{Y_i}|T_i=1]=\overline{Y_i(1)}$.

- $\overline{Y}|T_i=1$ is an unbiased estimator of the population mean of potential outcomes under treatment.

- The same logic applies for units randomly assigned to control:

\centering
$E_R[\overline{Y_i}|T_i=0]=\overline{Y_i(0)}$.

## Extra: Randomization is powerful (3)

 -  The same logic applies when we measure $Y_i$ for the control units ($Y_i|T_i=0$).  So $\overline{Y_i}|T_i=0$, which we can calculate, gives us an unbiased estimate of $\overline{Y_i(0)}$.

- So we can write down an estimator for the ATE:

\centering
	$\hat{\overline{\tau_i}} = ( \overline{Y_i(1)} | T_i = 1 ) - ( \overline{Y_i(0)} | T_i = 0 )$

- In expectation, or on average across repeated experiments, $\hat{\overline{\tau_i}}$ equals the ATE:

\centering
	$E_R[Y_i| T_i = 1 ] - E_R[Y_i | T_i = 0] = \overline{Y_i(1)} - \overline{Y_i(0)}$.


- So we can just take the difference of these unbiased estimators of $\overline{Y_i(1)}$ and
 $\overline{Y_i(0)}$ to get an unbiased estimate of the ATE.
# Estimation, Estimators, Bias, Consistency, Given Randomization

## Estimating the ATE in an RCT:

Here are two proposals for estimating the ATE. How would we know whether either
or both of them work well (trick question)? (What do we want estimators to do for us?)

```{r echo=TRUE}
est1 <- function(Z,Y){
    mean(Y[Z==1]) - mean(Y[Z==0])
}
est2 <- function(Z,Y){
    coef(lm(Y~Z))[["Z"]]
}

with(dat,est1(Z=Z,Y=Y))
with(dat,est2(Z=Z,Y=Y))
```

## How does randomization help us trust our estimators? {.shrink}

This is a simulation assessing **estimation bias** (and hinting at **consistency**)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## The truth:
with(dat,mean(y1-y0))

new_exp <- function(Z){
    ## This next shuffles Z
    newZ <- sample(Z)
    return(newZ)}

new_est <- function(newZ,y0,y1,the_est){
    newY <- newZ * y1 + (1-newZ)*y0
    result <- the_est(Z=newZ,Y=newY)
}

set.seed(1235)
dist_est1 <- with(dat, replicate(100, new_est(newZ=new_exp(Z),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
mean(dist_est1)
```

## How does randomization help us trust our estimators?

Note: (1) Different simulations give slightly different results and (2) more simulations differ from each other less.


```{r, echo=TRUE}

set.seed(1235)
dist_est1a <- with(dat, replicate(100, new_est(newZ=new_exp(Z),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
mean(dist_est1a)
dist_est1b <- with(dat, replicate(100, new_est(newZ=new_exp(Z),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
mean(dist_est1b)

dist_est2a <- with(dat, replicate(10000, new_est(newZ=new_exp(Z),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
mean(dist_est2a)
dist_est2b <- with(dat, replicate(10000, new_est(newZ=new_exp(Z),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
mean(dist_est2b)
```

## How does randomization help us trust our estimators?

What did randomization provide here?

 1. Grounds for repetition (i.e. we **knew** how to repeat the generation of $Z$),
 2. No need to mention `x1` (we could check to see if we should worry about x1).
 3. an unbiased estimator.

## What about if we didn't know exactly how Z was assigned? {.allowframebreaks}

Imagine that `x1` causes `Z` (here, Z is randomized but x1 changes Z before revealing y0 or y1):

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
	  Z  \arrow[from=1-1,to=1-4] &    &    & Y \\
	   x_1 \arrow[from=2-1,to=1-1] \arrow[from=2-1,to=1-4]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}


```{r biasexample, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
new_biased_exp <- function(Z,x1){
    newZ1 <- sample(Z)
    # newZ <- newZ1*rbinom(10,size=1,prob=(x1+1)/4)
    newZ <- pnorm(x1+newZ1)>pnorm(median(x1+newZ1))
    return(as.numeric(newZ))
}
trueATE <- with(dat,mean(y1-y0))
with(dat,est1(new_biased_exp(Z,x1),Y))

set.seed(1235)
dist_est_biased <- with(dat, replicate(10000, new_est(newZ=new_biased_exp(Z,x1),y0=y0,y1=y1,the_est=est1)))
summary(trueATE-dist_est_biased)
## And recall our previous distribution of our estimator across randomizations
## This next is unbiased (mean \approx 0)
summary(trueATE-dist_est2a)
```

## What about if we didn't know exactly how Z was assigned?

Imagine that `x1` causes `Z` (here, Z is randomized but x1 changes Z before revealing y0 or y1):

```{r figbias, out.width=".7\\textwidth"}
plot(density(dist_est2a),ylim=c(0,.8))
lines(density(na.omit(dist_est_biased)),col="blue")
abline(v=with(dat,mean(y1-y0)))
points(c(mean(dist_est_biased,na.rm=TRUE),mean(dist_est2a)),c(0,0),pch=c(17,18),cex=2,col=c("blue","black"))
```

## What about if we didn't know how Z was assigned at all?

How would we assess bias if we didn't know that $x_1$ caused $Z$?

 - We cannot simply shuffle Z. Because we don't know how Z arose.
 - Do we know how x1 was generated? If so, we could re-generate x1 and *hope* that our x1 to Z function is right
 - We could repeatedly re-generate Y itself if we **knew** how it was created.
 - We could resample the entire dataset if we **knew** how it was sampled.

So: **known randomization allows us to assess bias.**

# Summary and Overview

## Benefits of Randomized Designs

Randomization makes $y_1, y_0, \mathbf{X} \perp Z$. How to make use of this fact in a randomized experiment?

 1. Interpretable comparisons (lack of omitted variable bias, confounding,
    selection bias)
      - Can I interpret differences in outcome as caused by $Z$ and not $X$?
	Is it easy to confuse the effect of $Z$  with the  effects of $X$?
      - How does  randomization do this? How  does randomization eliminate
	**alternative explanations**? (Recall that it does not exactly balance $X$.)
 2. Reliable statistical inferences (estimators and tests)
      - The idea of **design-based** versus **model-based** statistical
	inference (next few slides).

## Design Based Approach: Estimate Averages

  1. Notice that the observed $Y_i$ are a sample from  the (small, finite)
     population of $(y_{i,1},y_{i,0})$.
  2. Decide to focus on the average, $\bar{\tau}$, because sample averages,
     $\hat{\bar{\tau}}$ are unbiased and consistent estimators of population
     averages under random sampling (where no covariate determines the sample
     inclusion probability or assignment to $Z_i$).
  3. Estimate $\bar{\tau}$ with the observed difference in means.

## Lingering Questions?

# Appendix

## Design Based Approach: Test Hypotheses

 1. Make a guess about $\tau_i$.
 2. Then measure surprise or consistency of data with this guess given the
    design. (Given all of the ways this experiment could have  occurred, how
    many look more extreme than what we observe? Does our observation look
    typical or rare?)
