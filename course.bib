	abstract = {Ethics in social science experimentation and data
		  collection are often discussed but rarely articulated in
		  writing as part of research outputs. Although papers
		  typically reference human subjects research approvals from
		  relevant institutional review boards, most recognize that
		  such boards are not comprehensive ethical assessments. We
		  propose a structured ethics appendix to provide details on
		  the following: policy equipoise, role of the researcher,
		  potential harms to participants and nonparticipants,
		  conflicts of interest, intellectual freedom, feedback to
		  participants, and foreseeable misuse of research results.
		  We discuss each of these, and some of the norms and
		  challenging situations of each. We believe that discussing
		  such issues explicitly in appendices of papers, even if
		  briefly, will serve two purposes: more complete
		  communication of ethics can improve discussions of papers
		  and can clarify and improve the norms themselves.},

	abstract = {Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics,
		  Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common
		  underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through
		  numerous examples. It also presents a detailed description
		  of available software implementations in R. The R packages
		  and source code for the analyses are available at
		  http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of
		  multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and
		  basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the
		  Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to
		  perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear
		  models and general parametric models. It also introduces
		  the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient
		  interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general
		  context. Following this theoretical framework, the book
		  explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's
		  all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast
		  tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models,
		  and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews
		  other multiple comparison procedures, such as
		  resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential
		  or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple
		  comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling
		  multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making
		  and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained
		  introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book
		  offers strategies for constructing the procedures and
		  illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing
		  in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers
		  with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple
		  comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz discuss
		  the book.},

@article{longervi:2000,
	abstract = {Abstract In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary
		  least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual
		  tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their
		  use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a
		  heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM),
		  however, are consistent even in the presence of
		  heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications
		  that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version
		  known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0
		  often results in incorrect inferences when N $\leq$ 250,
		  while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of
		  the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well
		  even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data
		  analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM
		  whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2)
		  the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be
		  determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and
		  (3) when N $\leq$ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be
		  used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors
		  of statistical software to add this estimator to their
		  programs.},

@article{miratrix2021multisite,
	abstract = {AbstractResearchers face many choices when conducting
		  large-scale multisite individually randomized control
		  trials. One of the most common quantities of interest in
		  multisite RCTs is the overall average effect. Even this
		  quantity is non-trivial to define and estimate. The
		  researcher can target the average effect across individuals
		  or sites. Furthermore, the researcher can target the effect
		  for the experimental sample or a larger population. If
		  treatment effects vary across sites, these estimands can
		  differ. Once an estimand is selected, an estimator must be
		  chosen. Standard estimators, such as fixed-effects
		  regression, can be biased. We describe 15 estimators,
		  consider which estimands they are appropriate for, and
		  discuss their properties in the face of cross-site effect
		  heterogeneity. Using data from 12 large multisite RCTs, we
		  estimate the effect (and standard error) using each
		  estimator and compare the results. We assess the extent
		  that these decisions matter in practice and provide
		  guidance for applied researchers.},

@misc{rosenbaum2009,
	abstract = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to
		  demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in
		  their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have
		  very different effects on one outcome but similar effects
		  on another outcome. These ``demonstrations'' may take the
		  form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an
		  equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal
		  and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures
		  often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component
		  hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels
		  to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized
		  trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for
		  each component test, and hence also for the combined
		  procedure. In an observational study---that is, in a study
		  of treatments that were not randomly assigned---there is
		  typically concern that significance levels for testing
		  hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by
		  failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment
		  covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of
		  virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of
		  such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by
		  a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible
		  magnitudes of potential bias, yields a corresponding
		  interval of possible significance levels. Some
		  observational studies are sensitive to very small
		  unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large
		  biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component
		  hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for
		  complex hypotheses tested by combining component
		  significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of
		  the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal
		  intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of
		  delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after
		  discharge.},

	abstract = {A sensitivity analysis displays the increase in
		  uncertainty that attends an inference when a key assumption
		  is relaxed. In matched observational studies of treatment
		  effects, a key assumption in some analyses is that subjects
		  matched for observed covariates are comparable, and this
		  assumption is relaxed by positing a relevant covariate that
		  was not observed and not controlled by matching. What
		  properties would such an unobserved covariate need to have
		  to materially alter the inference about treatment effects?
		  For ease of calculation and reporting, it is convenient
		  that the sensitivity analysis be of low dimension, perhaps
		  indexed by a scalar sensitivity parameter, but for
		  interpretation in specific contexts, a higher dimensional
		  analysis may be of greater relevance. An amplification of a
		  sensitivity analysis is defined as a map from each point in
		  a low dimensional sensitivity analysis to a set of points,
		  perhaps a 'curve,' in a higher dimensional sensitivity
		  analysis such that the possible inferences are the same for
		  all points in the set. Possessing an amplification, an
		  investigator may calculate and report the low dimensional
		  analysis, yet have available the interpretations of the
		  higher dimensional analysis.},
