  ABSTRACT = {Abstract In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N $\leq$ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N $\leq$ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

@ARTICLE{miratrix2021multisite,
  ABSTRACT = {AbstractResearchers face many choices when conducting large-scale multisite individually randomized control trials. One of the most common quantities of interest in multisite RCTs is the overall average effect. Even this quantity is non-trivial to define and estimate. The researcher can target the average effect across individuals or sites. Furthermore, the researcher can target the effect for the experimental sample or a larger population. If treatment effects vary across sites, these estimands can differ. Once an estimand is selected, an estimator must be chosen. Standard estimators, such as fixed-effects regression, can be biased. We describe 15 estimators, consider which estimands they are appropriate for, and discuss their properties in the face of cross-site effect heterogeneity. Using data from 12 large multisite RCTs, we estimate the effect (and standard error) using each estimator and compare the results. We assess the extent that these decisions matter in practice and provide guidance for applied researchers.},

  ABSTRACT = {In randomized experiments, it is sometimes important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or to demonstrate that the treatments have very different effects on one outcome but similar effects on another outcome. These ``demonstrations'' may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component significance levels to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid significance levels for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study---that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned---there is typically concern that significance levels for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all observational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias, yields a corresponding interval of possible significance levels. Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component significance levels. We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.},

  ABSTRACT = {A sensitivity analysis displays the increase in uncertainty that attends an inference when a key assumption is relaxed. In matched observational studies of treatment effects, a key assumption in some analyses is that subjects matched for observed covariates are comparable, and this assumption is relaxed by positing a relevant covariate that was not observed and not controlled by matching. What properties would such an unobserved covariate need to have to materially alter the inference about treatment effects? For ease of calculation and reporting, it is convenient that the sensitivity analysis be of low dimension, perhaps indexed by a scalar sensitivity parameter, but for interpretation in specific contexts, a higher dimensional analysis may be of greater relevance. An amplification of a sensitivity analysis is defined as a map from each point in a low dimensional sensitivity analysis to a set of points, perhaps a 'curve,' in a higher dimensional sensitivity analysis such that the possible inferences are the same for all points in the set. Possessing an amplification, an investigator may calculate and report the low dimensional analysis, yet have available the interpretations of the higher dimensional analysis.},
